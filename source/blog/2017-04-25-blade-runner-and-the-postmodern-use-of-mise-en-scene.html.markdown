Through the detective figure Deckard, Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner explores postmodern questions of authenticity and the reliability of stories (narratives) big or small.

A central exploration in many postmodern theories is the loss or crisis of faith in traditional narratives and myths.

The narratives that shape our understanding of the world and help rationalise our place in it are called "meta-narratives". Meta-narratives are the overarching stories that explain and legitimise knowledge or belief such as Christianity, Communism and Scientific progress.

In postmodernity, faith in these narratives is shaken and undermined. In an ultra-connected world, we feel increasingly disconnected.

In Blade Runner the notion of history, or how we have become to be, is a meta-narrative that is questioned explicitly.

Blade Runner subverts our sense of history through the technique of mise-en-scene. 

In Blade Runner, Rachel, dressed as the archetypical femme fatal of film noir, goes to Deckard’s apartment with the intention of questioning him about the results of a ‘Voight-Kampff’. 

The scene moves smoothly into the new space of Deckard’s apartment with a traditional establishing shot, the framing of the important scene adheres to the Classic Hollywood continuity editing system - an editing system that aims to provide viewers with linear notion of time and space.

The use of the establishing shot in this scene gives the viewer time to process the alien-like mise-en-scene. 

The mise-en-scene combines the common domestic with the bizarre and unrecognisable, imbuing the scene with an eerie sense of the familiar, which raises questions about a disconnected sense of heritage. Although the domestic aspects are familiar with our own, the kitchen sink and cupboards, we are unable to relate the aesthetic and technological advances to our contemporary life. 

The mise-en-scene is important as it reveals that underneath all of the questions about Rachel’s authenticity there is a lack of rational connection with our society to the society shown. The structures that surround the characters are familiar but also disconnected from any logical progression in fashion and science. As Rachel is questioned we too question what is knowable and stable in Blade Runner's vision of near-future L.A.

This disruption in historical, linear progression is seen earlier in the film, during the opening scenes, where we are shown a future Los Angeles disconnected from the present day geographic entity. Los Angeles has been transformed into a city splintering upwards with harsh vertical lines, dark shadows and bright lights; Los Angeles has been transformed into a city more reminiscent of New York.[1] The philosopher Derrida once declared that nothing is outside the text; the use of continuity editing could itself be seen as an ironic example of this.[2] The classical Hollywood system of narrative is itself an organizing system which explains and legitimises knowledge, and like the historical meta-narrative it orders events into cause and effect. Blade Runner critiques the use of meta-narratives to explain and rationalize while functioning from within one, therefore is a representation of postmodernity.
