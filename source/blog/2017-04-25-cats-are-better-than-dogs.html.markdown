The sessions are designed to give patients who are recovering from life changing injuries, illnesses or surgery - including elderly patients with dementia - a chance to learn new skills, enjoy each other’s’ company and be distracted from pain or discomfort.&nbsp; Patients frequently tell us that the sessions are friendly, inclusive, calming and fun. &nbsp;
We also run a monthly music programme that brings entertainment and light relief to our patients. All the musicians are professionally trained and highly skilled in engaging patients within their performances. It is a joy to watch patients and staff join in.
A recent study showed that patients who took part in the arts activities of Sheffield Teaching Hospitals experienced a 'significant 20% improvement in mood and significant reduction in levels of anxiety'.&nbsp;&nbsp;
